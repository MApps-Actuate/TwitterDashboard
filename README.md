TwitterDashboard
================

This dashboard is a showcase of using Twitter as datasource. It's intended audience is anyone who is interested in adding social media data to their applications. A unique thing about this demo is that it overcomes the rows returned limitation by joining datasets to bring back more data than a single Twitter API call does. A big benefit of using this dashboard is the ability to drag and drop it from the dashboard gallery to enhance any existing demo. It brings instant credibility and interest to the audience when doing a search on their company name.

Social Media example. Can be used to enhance any other demo.
